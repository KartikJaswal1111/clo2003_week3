Learning About Linux:

Introduction:
This document contains the basic learning about Linux

Section1: Linux History

1.1 Linux is a kernel and the open source community where everyone can use the code in the kernel and it is easy to use as it is efficient and user-friendly.

1.2 The Origin of Linux was in 1991 where the Linus Torvalds write the new code for their own operating system that he wants to make independent and easily compatible with other resources.

1.3 As Linux has evolved and its significance in modern computing in various ways: It is free software which is open-source where developers or any user can easily modify.
Moreover it support multiple languages and file system where the users can easily edit their files and make changes in the current environment.

Section 2: Linux Distributions:

2.1 Linux distribution is basically the computing requirement as they are specific for user group or the business users. These are mostly divided into three categories:

2.2. Full core Linux Distributions: Examples include: Debian, Slackware
     Specialized Linux Distributions: Examples include: CentOS, Mint
     LiveCD Test Distributions: Modern PCs can be boot from a CD instead of the Hard drive for install. 	       	       
		
2.3 These various distributions are according the user interface and how user want to use the file as full core is basically for the one or more desktop environment where Linux application is available and is recompiled with Kernel.

Specialized is ythe main distribution but it is having a subset of applications which is use for the specific use areas.

LiveCD is the bootable Linux CD distribution which is now used as the CD drive to boot the system.
 
Section 3: Basic Linux Commands:


• cd: Change directories.

cd .. Change current directory to parent directory

• sudo: It is as the superuser run as administrator

• ls: List files and Directories
	
	ls-l It shows the long listing of the content of the current directory.

• cp: Copying files and directory

• mv: Move one or more files or directories.

• rm: it is use for removing files and directories.

• cat: Display the content of file.

• head: show the first ten lines of the file.

• tail: show the last ten lines of the file.

• grep: It shows the string of characters in the file.

• man: user access to manual pages.

• chown: It is use to change the file owner or group.

• chmod: it allows to change the permissions on the file.

Section 4 Conclusion:

We have learned about the basic of Linux how it is used in todays environment and how much it is distributed and easy to use or the open source and it is the valuable skills to learn because we easily write the commands and use that in the terminal.
